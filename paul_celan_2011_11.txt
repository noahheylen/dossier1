Paul Celan(23 November 1920 - 20 April 1970)
(born Cern&#259;u&#355;i, Bukovina, Kingdom of Romania, current Chernivtsi,
Ukraine - c. , Paris) was a poet and translator. He was born as Paul Antschel into
a Jewish family in Romania, and changed his name to "Paul Celan" (where Celan
in Romanian would be pronounced Chelan, and was derived from Ancel,
pronounced Antshel), becoming one of the major German-language poets of the
post-World War II era.
Life
Early life
Celan was born in 1920 into a German-speaking Jewish family in
Cern&#259;u&#355;i, Northern Bukovina, a region then part of Romania and
earlier part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, among others (now part of Ukraine).
His father, Leo Antschel, was a Zionist who advocated his son's education in
Hebrew at Safah Ivriah, an institution previously convinced of the wisdom of
assimilation into Austrian culture, and one which favourably received Chaim
Weizmann of the World Zionist Organization in 1927. His mother, Fritzi, was an
avid reader of German literature who insisted German be the language of the
house. After his Bar Mitzvah in 1933, Celan abandoned Zionism (at least to some
extent) and finished his formal Hebrew education, instead becoming active in
Jewish Socialist organizations and fostering support for the Republican cause in
the Spanish Civil War. His earliest known poem, titled Mother's Day 1938 was an
earnest, if sentimental, profession of love. Paul graduated from the
gymnasium/high school called Liceul Marele Voivod Mihai (Great Voivode Mihai
High School) in 1938.
In 1938, Celan travelled to Tours, France, to study medicine. The Anschluss
precluded Vienna, and Romanian schools were harder to get in to due to the
newly-imposed Jewish quota. But he returned to Cern&#259;u&#355;i in 1939
to study literature and Romance languages. His journey to France took him
through Berlin as the events of Kristallnacht unfolded, and also introduced him to
his uncle, Bruno Schrager, who later was among the French detainees who died
at Birkenau.
Life during World War II
The Soviet occupation of Bukovina in June 1940 deprived Celan of any lingering
illusions about Stalinism and Soviet Communism stemming from his earlier

socialist engagements; the Soviets quickly imposed bureaucratic reforms on the
university where he was studying Romance philology and deportations to Siberia
started. Nazi Germany and Romania brought ghettos, internment, and forced
labour a year later (see Romania during World War II).
On arrival in Cern&#259;u&#355;i July 1941 the German SS Einsatzkommando
and their Romanian allies set the city's Great Synagogue on fire. In October, the
Romanians deported a large number of Jews after forcing them into a ghetto,
where Celan translated William Shakespeare's Sonnets and continued to write his
own poetry, all the while being exposed to traditional Yiddish songs and culture.
Before the ghetto was dissolved in the fall of that year, Celan was pressed into
labor, first clearing the debris of a demolished post office, and then gathering
and destroying Russian books.
The local mayor strove to mitigate the harsh circumstances until the governor of
Bukovina had the Jews rounded up and deported, starting on a Saturday night in
June 1942. Accounts of his whereabouts on that evening vary, but it is certain
that Celan was not with his parents when they were taken from their home on
June 21 and sent by train to an internment camp in Transnistria, where twothirds of the deportees perished. Celan's parents were taken across the Southern
Bug and handed over to the Germans, where his father likely perished of typhus
and his mother was shot dead after being exhausted by forced labour. Later that
year, after having himself been taken to the labour camps in the Old Kingdom,
Celan would receive reports of his parents' deaths.
Celan remained in these labour camps until February 1944, when the Red Army's
advance forced the Romanians to abandon them, whereupon he returned to
Cern&#259;u&#355;i shortly before the Soviets returned to reassert their
control. There, he worked briefly as a nurse in the mental hospital. Early versions
of Todesfuge were circulated at this time, a poem that clearly relied on accounts
coming from the now-liberated camps in Poland. Friends from this period recall
Celan expressing immense guilt over his separation from his parents, whom he
had tried to convince to go into hiding prior to the deportations, shortly before
their death.
Life after the war
Considering emigration to Palestine and wary of widespread Soviet antisemitism,
Celan left the USSR in 1945 for Bucharest, where he remained until 1947. He
was active in the Jewish literary community as both a translator of Russian
literature into Romanian, and as a poet, publishing his work under a variety of
pseudonyms. The literary scene of the time was richly populated with surrealists

— Gellu Naum, Ilarie Voronca, Gherasim Luca, Paul P&#259;un, and Dolfi Trost
—, and it was in this period that Celan developed pseudonyms both for himself
and his friends, including the one he took as his pen name.
A version of Todesfuge appeared as Tangoul Mor&#355;ii ("Death Tango") in a
Romanian translation of May 1947. The surrealist ferment of the time was such
that additional remarks had to be published explaining that the dancing and
musical performances of the poem were realities of the extermination camp life.
Night and Fog, the earliest documentary on Auschwitz (Alain Resnais, 1955),
includes a description of the Auschwitz Orchestra, an institution organized by the
SS to assemble and play selections of German dances and popular songs. (The
SS man interviewed by Claude Lanzmann for his film Shoah, who rehearsed the
songs prisoners were made to sing in the death camp, remarked that no Jews
who had taught the songs survived.)
Exodus and Paris years
Due to the emerging of the communist regime in Romania, Celan fled Romania
for Vienna, Austria. It was there that he befriended Ingeborg Bachmann, who
had just completed a dissertation on Martin Heidegger. Facing a city divided
between occupying powers and with little resemblance to the mythic city it once
was, which had harboured the then-shattered Austro-Hungarian Jewish
community, he moved to Paris in 1948. In that year his first poetry collection,
Der Sand aus den Urnen ("Sand from the Urns"), was published in Vienna by A.
Sexl. His first few years in Paris were marked by intense feelings of loneliness
and isolation, as expressed in letters to his colleagues, including his longtime
friend from Cern&#259;u&#355;i, Petre Solomon. It was also during this time
that he exchanged many letters with Diet Kloos, a young Dutch singer and antiNazi resister who saw her husband of a few months tortured to death. She
visited him twice in Paris between 1949 and 1951.
In 1952 Celan's writing began to gain recognition when he read his poetry on his
first reading trip to Germany where he was invited to read at the semiannual
meetings of Group 47. At their May meeting he read his poem Todesfuge ("Death
Fugue"), a depiction of concentration camp life. His reading style, which was
maybe based on the way a prayer is given in a synagogue and Hungarian folk
poems, was off-putting to some of the German audience. His poetry received a
mixed reaction. When Ingeborg Bachmann, with whom Celan had an affair, won
the Group's prize for her collection Die gestundete Zeit (The Extended Hours),
Celan (whose work had received only six votes) said "After the meeting, only six
people remembered my name". He did not attend any other meeting of the
Group.

In November 1951, he met the graphic artist Gisèle de Lestrange, in Paris. He
would send her many wonderful love letters, influenced by Franz Kafka's
correspondence with Milena Jesenska and Felice Bauer. They married on
December 21, 1952, despite the opposition of her aristocratic family, and during
the following 18 years they wrote over 700 letters, including a very active
exchange with Hermann Lenz and his wife, Hanne. He made his living as a
translator and lecturer in German at the École Normale Supérieure. He was also a
close friend of Nelly Sachs, who later won the Nobel Prize for literature.
Celan became a French citizen in 1955 and lived in Paris. Celan's sense of
persecution increased after the widow of a friend, the French-German poet Yvan
Goll, accused him of having plagiarised her husband's work. Celan was awarded
the Bremen Literature Prize in 1958 and the Georg Büchner Prize in 1960.
Celan committed suicide by drowning in the Seine river around April 20, 1970.
Celan: poetry and poetics
Poetry after Auschwitz
The death of his parents and the experience of the Shoah (or Holocaust) are
defining forces in Celan's poetry and his use of language. In his Bremen Prize
speech,
Celan said of language after Auschwitz that:
"Only one thing remained reachable, close and secure amid all losses: language.
Yes, language. In spite of everything, it remained secure against loss. But it had
to go through its own lack of answers, through terrifying silence, through the
thousand darknesses of murderous speech. It went through. It gave me no
words for what was happening, but went through it. Went through and could
resurface, 'enriched' by it all."
It has been written, inaccurately perhaps, that German is the only language that
allows (us?) to penetrate the horror of Auschwitz, to describe death from within.
His most famous poem, the early Todesfuge, commemorating the death camps,
is a work of great complexity and extraordinary power, and may have drawn
some key motives from the poem Er by Immanuel Weissglas, another Czernovitz
poet. The dual character of Margarete-Sulamith, with her golden-ashen hair,
appears as a reflection of Celan's Jewish-German culture, while the blue-eyed

"Master from Germany" embodies German Nazism.
In later years his poetry became progressively more cryptic, fractured and
monosyllabic, bearing comparison to the music of Anton Webern. He also
increased his use of German neologisms, especially in his later works
Fadensonnen ("Threadsuns") and Eingedunkelt ("Benighted"). In the eyes of
some, Celan attempted in his poetry either to destroy or remake the German
language. For others he retained a sense for the lyricism of the German language
which was rare in writers of that time. As he writes in a letter to his wife Gisèle
Lestrange on one of his trips to Germany:'The German I talk is not the same as
the language the German people are talking here'. Writing in German was a way
for him to think back and remember his parents, particularly his mother, from
whom he had learned the language. This is underlined in 'Wolfsbohne,' a poem in
which Paul Celan addresses his mother. The urgency and power of Celan's work
stem from his attempt to find words "after", to bear (impossible) witness in a
language that gives back no words "for that which happened".
In addition to writing poetry (in German and, earlier, in Romanian), he was an
extremely active translator and polyglot, translating literature from Romanian,
French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Russian, Hebrew and English into German.
Germany and German guilt
Recent commentaries on Celan's relationship to Germany (its "irreparable
offense", its "guilt" and — for many others — "silence" on the exterminations
after 1945, and after the war) often point to Celan's poem "Todtnauberg". This
poem was engendered by Celan's meeting and single encounter with the
philosopher Martin Heidegger. Celan had read Heidegger beginning in 1951, and
exclamation marks in his margin notes testify to an awareness that Heidegger
had allowed his remarks on the "greatness" of National Socialism in the 1953
edition of Introduction to Metaphysics to stand without further comment.
Celan visited West Germany periodically, including trips arranged by Hanne Lenz,
who worked in a publishing house in Stuttgart. Celan and his wife Gisèle often
visited Stuttgart and the area on stopovers during their many vacations to
Austria. On one of his trips, Celan gave a lecture at the University of Freiburg (on
July 24, 1967) which was attended by Heidegger, who gave Celan a copy of Was
heißt Denken? and invited him to visit his work retreat "die Hütte" ("the hut") at
Todtnauberg the following day and walk in the Schwarzwald. Although he may
not have been willing to be photographed with Heidegger after the Freiburg
lecture (or to contribute to Festschriften honoring Heidegger's work) Celan
accepted the invitation and even signed Heidegger's guest book at the famous

"hut".
The two walked in the woods. Celan impressed Heidegger with his knowledge of
botany and Heidegger is thought to have spoken about elements of his press
interview Only a God can save us now, which he had just given to Der Spiegel on
condition of posthumous publication. That would seem to be the extent of the
meeting. Todtnauberg was written shortly thereafter and sent to Heidegger as
the first copy of a limited bibliophile edition. Heidegger responded with no more
than a letter of perfunctory thanks.

Afternoon Of Circus And Citadel
In Brest, before the Fire-Hoops burning,
In the Tent, where Tigers sprang,
there I heard you, Finite, singing,
there I saw you, Mandelstam.
The Sky hung over the Roadstead,
the Gull, hung over the Crane.
The Finite sang there, the Constant –
you, the Gunboat, Baobab.
I hailed the Tricolor
with a Russian Word –
the Lost was Un-Lost,
the Heart Anchored there.

Aspen Tree
Aspen Tree, your leaves glance white into the dark.
My mother's hair was never white.
Dandelion, so green is the Ukraine.
My yellow-haired mother did not come home.
Rain cloud, above the well do you hover?
My quiet mother weeps for everyone.
Round star, you wind the golden loop.
My mother's heart was ripped by lead.
Oaken door, who lifted you off your hinges?
My gentle mother cannot return.

Corona
Autunm eats its leaf out of my hand: we are friends.
From the nuts we shell time and we teach it to walk:
then time returns to the shell.
In the mirror it's Sunday,
in dream there is room for sleeping,
our mouths speak the truth.
My eye moves down to the sex of my loved one:
we look at each other,
we exchange dark words,
we love each other like poppy and recollection,
we sleep like wine in the conches,
like the sea in the moon's blood ray.
We stand by the window embracing, and people look up from
the street:
it is time they knew!
It is time the stone made an effort to flower,
time unrest had a beating heart.
It is time it were time.
It is time.

Count The Almonds
Count the Almonds,
count, what was bitter, watched for you,
count me in:
I sought your Eye, as it opened and no one announced
you,
I spun that hidden Thread,
on which the Dew, of your thought,
slid down to the Pitchers,
that a Speech, which no one’s Heart found, guarded.
Only there did you enter wholly the Name, that is yours,
stepping sure-footedly into yourself,
the Hammers swung free in the Bell-Cradle of Silences,
yours,
the Listened-For reached you,
the Dead put its arm round you too,
and the three of you walked through the Evening.
Make me bitter.
Count me among the Almonds.

Snowfall, denser and denser,
dove-coloured as yesterday,
snowfall, as if even now you were sleeping.
White, stacked into distance.
Above it, endless,
the sleigh track of the lost.
Below, hidden,
presses up
what so hurts the eyes,
hill upon hill,
invisible.
On each,
fetched home into its today,
an I slipped away into dumbness:
wooden, a post.
There: a feeling,
blown across by the ice wind
attaching its dove- its snowcoloured cloth as a flag.

In Front Of A Candle
I formed the holder of gold,
as you told me to mother,
gold, out of which She comes,
a shade, to me, in the middle
of fracturing hours,
your
being-dead’s daughter.
Slender in shape,
a thin, almond-eyed shadow,
her mouth and her sex
danced round by creatures from sleep,
out of the cave of the gold,
she rises up,
to the summit of Now.
With night-dark-shrouded
lips,
I speak the Prayer:
In the name of the Three
who fight with each other, until
heaven reaches down into the graveyard of feeling,
in the name of the Three, whose rings
gleam on my finger, whenever
I loose the hair of the trees into the abyss,
so that the richer floods rush down through the deeps-

in the name of the first of the Three
who shrieked,
when he was called on to live,
where his word went before him,
in the name of the second, who watched it and wept,
in the name of the third, who piles
white stones in the middle –
I say you are free
of the amen that overpowers us,

there, where tower-high it enters the sea,
there, where the grey one, the dove

You still, you still, you still,
a dead woman’s child,
sealed to the No of my yearning,
wedded to a cleft in time
to which the mother-word led me,

would pass through the hand
that now, and now, grasps at my heart!

Night Ray
Most brightly of all burned the hair of my evening loved one:
to her I send the coffin of lightest wood.
Waves billow round it as round the bed of our dream in Rome;
it wears a white wig as I do and speaks hoarsely:
it talks as I do when I grant admittance to hearts.
It knows a French song about love, I sang it in autumn
when I stopped as a tourist in Lateland and wrote my letters
to morning.
A fine boat is that coffin carved in the coppice of feelings.
I too drift in it downbloodstream, younger still than your eye.
Now you are young as a bird dropped dead in March snow,
now it comes to you, sings you its love song from France.
You are light: you will sleep through my spring till it's over.
I am lighter:
in front of strangers I sing.

Tallow Lamp
The monks with hairy fingers opened the book: September.
Now Jason pelts with snow the newly sprouting grain.
The forest gave you a necklace of hands. So dead you walk the rope.
To your hair a darker blue is imparted; I speak of love.
Shells I speak and light clouds, and a boat buds in the rain.
A little stallion gallops across the leafing fingers-Black the gate leaps open, I sing:
How did we live here?
(from Mohn und Gedachtnis by Paul Celan, trans. by Michael Hamburger)

Tenebrae
We are near, Lord,
near and at hand.
Handled already, Lord,
clawed and clawing as though
the body of each of us were
your body, Lord.
Pray, Lord,
pray to us,
we are near.
Wind-awry we went there,
went there to bend
over hollow and ditch.
To be watered we went there, Lord.
It was blood, it was
what you shed, Lord.
It gleamed.
It cast your image into our eyes, Lord.
Our eyes and our mouths are open and empty, Lord.
We have drunk, Lord.
The blood and the image that was in the blood, Lord.
Pray, Lord.
We are near.
Paul Celan

The Poles
The Poles
are within us,
insurmountable
while Awake,
we sleep across, to the Gate
of Mercy,
I lose you to you, that
is my Snow-Comfort,
say, that Jerusalem is,
say, as if I were this
your Whiteness,
as if you were
mine,
as if without us we could be we,
I open your leaves, forever,
you bless, you bed
us free.

The Straitening
*
Driven into the
terrain
with the unmistakable track:
grass, written asunder. The stones, white,
with the shadows of grassblades:
Do not read any more - look!
Do not look any more - go!
Go, your hour
has no sisters, you are are at home. A wheel, slow,
rolls out of itself, the spokes
climb,
climb on a blackish field, the night
needs no stars, nowhere
does anyone ask after you.
*
Nowhere
does anyone ask after you The place where they lay, it has
a name - it has
none. They did not lie there. Something
lay between them. They
did not see through it.
Did not see, no,
spoke of
words. None
awoke,
sleep
came over them.

Came, came. Nowhere

you are asleep.

years, years, a finger

around:

it is split wide open, here
it grew together again - who
covered it up?

Covered it

Came, came.
Came a word, came,
came through the night,

Ash.
Ash, ash.
Night.

Gales, from the beginning of time,
whirl of particles, the other,

know it, though, we
read it in the book, was

Was, was

did we touch
each other - each other with
these
hands?
There was written too, that.
Where? We
put a silence over it,
stilled with poison, great,
a
green
silence, a sepal, an
idea of vegetation attached to it green, yes,
attached, yes,
under a crafty
sky.
Of, yes,
vegetation.
Yes.
Gales, whirl of particles, there was
time left, time
to try it out with the stone - it
was hospitable, it
did not cut in. How
lucky we were:
Grainy,
grainy and stringy. Stalky,

Spoke, spoke.

We
would not let go, stood
in the midst, a

it came.
Came at us, came
through us, patched
invisibly, patched
away at the last membrane

the world, a millicrystal,
shot up, shot up.

Shot up, shot up.
Then Nights, demixed. Circles,
green or blue, scarlet

choirs, at that time, the
psalms. Ho, hosannah.
So

Nothing,

There Was Earth
There was Earth in them, and
they dug.
They dug and they dug, and so
their Day went by, and their Night. And they did not praise God,
who, so they heard, wanted all this,
who, so they heard, knew of all this.
They dug and they heard nothing more;
did not grow wise, invented no Song,
thought up for themselves no Language.
They dug.
There came a Silence, there came a Storm,
There came every Ocean.
I dig, you dig, and it digs, the Worm,
and the Singing, there, says: They dig.
O someone, o none, o no one, o you:
Where did it lead to, that nowhere-leading?
O you dig and I dig, and I dig towards you,
and on our finger awakens the Ring.

To Stand In The Shadow
To stand in the Shadow

For no-one and nothing to Stand.

Twelve Years
The line
that remained, that
became true: . . . your
house in Paris -- become
the alterpiece of your hands.
Breathed through thrice,
shone through thrice.
...................
It's turning dumb, turning deaf
behind our eyes.
I see the poison flower
in all manner of words and shapes.
Go. Come.
Love blots out its name: to
you it ascribes itself.

it recognizes you,

When You Lie
When you lie
in the Bed of lost Flag-Cloth,
with blue-black Syllables, in Snow-Eyelash-Shadow,
the Crane through Thoughtshowers,
comes gliding, steelyyou open for him.
His beak ticks the Hour for you
at every Mouth – at every
bell-stroke, with red-hot Rope, a SilentMillennium,
Un-Pulse and Pulse
mint each other to death,
the Dollars, the Cents,
rain hard through your Pores,
in
Second-Shapes
you fly there and bar
the Doors Yesterday and Tomorrow – phosphorescent,
Forever-Teeth,
buds the one, and buds the
other breast,
towards the Grasping, under
the Thrusts –: so thick,
so deeply
strewn
the starry
CraneSeed.

Whorish Other-When
Whorish other-when. And Eternity

Mud-drowned

Two Fingers, hand-far,

Vow.

With Every Thought
With every Thought I went
out of the World: there you were,
you my Gentle One, you my Open One, and –
you received us.
Who
says that for us everything died,
that for us there the Eye broke?
Everything woke, all things began.
Vast, a Sun came swimming by, bright
a Soul and a Soul engaged, clear,
masterfully made a silence for it
a path ahead.
Lightly
you opened your Lap, quiet
rose a Breath in the Aether,
and what became cloud, was it not,
was it not Form, and for us then,
was it not
as good as a Name?
Paul Celan

With The Voice
With the voice of the Field-mouse
You squeak up,
a sharp
Clamp,
you bite through my Shirt into the Skin,
a Cloth,
you slither over my Mouth,
in the midst of my,
to you, Shadow, burdensome,
Speech.

Your Hand
Your hand full of hours, you came to me – and I said:
‘Your hair is not brown.’
You lifted it, lightly,
on to the balance of grief,
it was heavier than I.
They come to you on their ships, and make it their load,
then put it on sale in the markets of lust.
You smile at me from the deep.
I weep at you from the scale that’s still light.
I weep: Your hair is not brown.
They offer salt-waves of the sea,
and you give them spume.
You whisper: ‘They’re filling the world with me now,
and for you I’m still a hollow way in the heart!
You say: ‘Lay the leaf-work of years by you, it’s time,
that you came here and kissed me.
The leaf-work of years is brown, your hair is not brown.
Paul Celan
