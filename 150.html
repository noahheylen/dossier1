    When I was little I used to go to the barber and the hair stylist and the
hair and makeup artist and the nail salons and the hair and makeup
artists,
and I would go, “Make sure you’re a good girl,” and I would go with the
hair stylist
and the hair and makeup artists and the nail salons and the hair and
makeup artists and the nail salons and the hair and makeup artists and
the nail salon and the hair salon.”
And it was all very positive. It was all about feeling good, and
getting a good look at what we’re all about. And then, somehow the
decisions became more dramatic and very personal. We’d lose sight of
the fact that we’re
really just one beautiful person, and that we can’t really express oursel-
ves, and that our
own person is just a collection of things that are not ours. And that’s the
bottom line
